# @todo:

- Re-add proper tests (need to figure out a good way to do this as it is dependent on having the sim running and etc.)
- Publish via github packages
- Should this package parse the yaml session info?
    - if so, we need to generate types for that as well
- Provide helper getters for retrieving larger chunks of data (for ex. session info only, local driver only, etc?)
- Make `dump-data.ts` script into a proper utility script (similar to generate types)
- Create new package for actual event detection
