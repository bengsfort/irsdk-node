# @irsdk-node/example-node-lap-timer

Example node.js script that waits for a session to start, and then will simply output lap data as a session is active. Good starting point for long-running processes that need to start and stop automatically when a session is joined.

## Usage

1. Clone and run install: `pnpm install`
2. Start the script via `pnpm script`.
3. Once a server/session is joined on iRacing, it should log lap data to the console.

> ‚ùïNOTE: This project was made using pnpm, and makes use of the workspace:^ protocol. To use with any other package manager, just replace the workspace:^ protocol with the latest version.

## Future

This project is just a copy of an old test script, and is not representative of 
production-level code. It will be replaced in due time.
