# irsdk-node

NodeJS bindings for the iRacing SDK. Aims to provide a thin barrier of entry to use the SDK from Node based apps. This repo just adds bindings for the current version of the SDK and is not a full node.js implementation. That would be a lot of fun (something like [pyirsdk](https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk) or [iracing-sdk](https://github.com/quimcalpe/iracing-sdk)), but unfortunately I do not have the time atm :)
